## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build as an EXE (Windows & Mac)

### 1. **Build the Production Web App**
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist/` folder with the production build.

### 2. **Package as an EXE (Windows)**
- Make sure `pkg` is installed (already in devDependencies).
- Run:
```bash
npm run build:exe
```
- This creates `POS.exe` in your project root.
- **When you launch POS.exe:**
  - The local server starts automatically.
  - The default browser opens a new tab at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. **Package as a Mac App (macOS)**
- Run:
```bash
npm run build:exe:all
```
- This creates executables for Windows, Mac, and Linux in your project root.
- On Mac, run the generated binary (e.g., `./POS-macos`) to start the server and open the browser.

#### **Auto-Open Browser on Launch**
- The launcher script (`server/launcher.js`) is responsible for starting the server and opening the browser automatically.
- You can customize the browser launch command in `server/launcher.js` if needed.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Build as a Desktop App (All Servers Running)

### **Option 1: Electron (Recommended for Desktop Experience)**
1. **Install Electron:**
   ```bash
   npm install electron --save-dev
   ```
2. **Create an Electron main file (e.g., `electron-main.js`):**
   - This file should start your local server (proxy and Vite build), then open a browser window pointing to `http://localhost:8000`.
3. **Add a script to `package.json`:**
   ```json
   "desktop": "electron electron-main.js"
   ```
4. **Run:**
   ```bash
   npm run desktop
   ```
   - This will launch the app in a native window with all servers running in the background.

### **Option 2: Batch/PowerShell Script (Windows Only)**
- Use the provided `start-dev.bat` or `start-dev.ps1` to launch both servers, then open the browser manually or add a command to auto-open it.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start
- For web: `npm run dev` (development) or `npm run build` + serve `dist/`
- For EXE: `npm run build:exe` (Windows) or `npm run build:exe:all` (Mac/Win/Linux)
- For desktop: Use Electron as described above
